Interface don't  have constructors as well as init blocks.

-> The interfaces are used because KOTLIN does not support MULTIPLE INHERITANCE (same as JAVA)
-> In interfaces by default all the functions, variables are abstract unless they have the body or the values resp.,
so we need not to mention them.
